Facts about Mean :
The mean (or average) is the most popular and well known measure of central tendency.
It can be used with both discrete and continuous data, although its use is most often with continuous data.
There are other types of means. Geometric mean, Harmonic mean and Arithmetic mean.
Mean is the only measure of central tendency where the sum of the deviations of each value from the mean is always zero.

Formula for finding Median :
If the count of numbers is odd: After sorting the sequence,
Median = {(N+1)/2}th value.
If the count of numbers is even: After sorting the sequence,
Median  =  Average of (N/2)th and {(N/2) + 1}th value.

Facts about Median :
Median is an important measure (compared to mean) for distorted data, because median is not so easily distorted. For example, median of {1, 2, 2, 5, 100) is 2 and mean is 22.
If the user adds a constant to every value, the mean and median increases by the same constant.
If the user multiplies every value by a constant, the mean and the median will also be multiplied by that constant.

Number of permutations when 'r' elements are arranged out of a total of 'n' elements is n Pr = n! / (n - r)!. 
For example, let n = 4 (A, B, C and D) and r = 2 (All permutations of size 2). The answer is 4!/(4-2)! = 12. 
The twelve permutations are AB, AC, AD, BA, BC, BD, CA, CB, CD, DA, DB and DC.

Important Properties of Permutation:
n P n = n*(n-1)*(n-2)*......*1 = n!.
n P 0 = n! / n! = 1.
n P 1 = n.
n P n-1 = n!.
n P r/n P r-1 = n - r + 1.

Permutation with repetition allowed: The number of permutation or arrangements of N numbers with repetition allowed will be NN. 
For Example, permutaions of {1,2} with repetitions will be {{1,1}, {1,2}, {2,1},{2,2}}.

Permutation with duplicates: The number of permutations or arrangements of N objects of which p1 are of one kind, 
p2 are of second kind, ..., pk are of k-th kind and the rest if any, are of different kinds is:
N! / (p1! * p2! *....*pk!).


Combination
Combination is the different selections of a given number of elements taken one by one, or some, or all at a time. 
For example, if we have two elements A and B, then there is only one way to 00select two items, we select both of them.

Number of combinations when 'r' elements are selected out of a total of 'n' elements is n C r = n! / [ (r !) * (n - r)! ]. 
For example, let n = 4 (A, B, C and D) and r = 2 (All combinations of size 2). The answer is 4!/((4-2)!*2!) = 6. 
The six combinations are AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD.

Important Properties of Combination:
n C 0 = n C n = 1.
n C r = n C n-r.
n C r + n C r-1 = n+1 C r.
n * n-1 C r-1 = (n - r + 1)* n C r-1.

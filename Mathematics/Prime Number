check if there aren't any factors of N except and 1 and N itself.

Algorithm:
If, N is less than 2. It is not prime, return False.
Else:
Iterate from 2 to N-1 and check if any of the numbers between 2 and N-1 (both inclusive) divides N or not.
If yes, then N is not prime, return False.
Otherwise, return True.

Analysis of the above algorithm: Since we are traversing linearly from 2 to N-1, the time complexity of the above
algorithm will be linear O(N).

num = int(input("Enter a number: "))  
  
if num > 1:  
   for i in range(2,num):  
       if (num % i) == 0:  
           print(num,"is not a prime number")  
           print(i,"times",num//i,"is",num)  
           break  
   else:  
       print(num,"is a prime number")  
         
else:  
   print(num,"is not a prime number")  

# Python program to display all the prime numbers within an interval

lower = 900
upper = 1000

print("Prime numbers between", lower, "and", upper, "are:")

for num in range(lower, upper + 1):
   # all prime numbers are greater than 1
   if num > 1:
       for i in range(2, num):
           if (num % i) == 0:
               break
       else:
           print(num)

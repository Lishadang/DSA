Given an integral number N. The task is to find the count of digits present in this number.
N = 2019

Number of digits in N here is 4 and,
the digits are: 2, 0, 1, 9.
  Check if the number N is not equals to zero.
  Increase the count of digits by 1 if N is not zero.
  Reduce the number by dividing it by 10.
  Repeat the above steps until the number is reduced to zero.
N not equals to 0
Increment digitsCount, digitsCount = digitsCount + 1.
digitsCount = 0 + 1 = 1.
N = N/10 = 58964/10 = 5896.

complexity of the solution is O(digitsCount).

Solution 2
number of digits in N = log10(N) + 1.
complexity of the solution is O(1).
